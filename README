Beckhoff PLC driver for Java 0.1
================================
This package provides a simple way to access Beckhoff PLCs via the AMS/ADS
protocol from pure Java. Variables on the PLC can be read and written,
and notifications can be used to have the PLC inform the Java program
of changes asynchronously. Symbol information is read from a TPY file
as provided by the Beckhoff system.

This code is by no means complete. It started as an experiment, when I
had to create a similar library for my employer, but could not implement
some of the ideas I had in mind. This stuff was written in my spare
time and has NO connection to the code I wrote at work -- this is a
Pure-Java project, whereas the code written for my employer was a Scheme
library. Having read "Clean Code" a while ago, I wanted to try some of
the principles detailed there, and this code base is my playground. Still
trying to get into the Test First mentality...

This code is based on the freely accessible Beckhof Information System
only.  I go to great lengths to keep it free from any commercial claims,
especially by my employer. I don't have a Beckhoff PLC or a Windows PC
for that matter, so I can NOT test the code, as testing at work would make
it my employer's property. So I have to rely on unit tests at the moment.
Do not except this code to work 100% correctly.


Help wanted
================================
What I could use at this point:

- TPY files provided without copyright or IP claims
- Beta testers!
- Ideas for additional functionality :)

Please keep in mind that I want to keep this project under the ISC
license, so I can not accept anything with a questionable IP background.


TODO
================================
- Test double/float conversion
- Unit tests in general
- Writing variables as laid out in the code
- Implement notification handling
- Read/Write multiple variables with a single AMS roundtrip
- Notifications on variable blocks (= multiple variables observed
  with a single notification)
- Retrieve TPY file from FTP server on the PLC
- TPY watchdog: TPY file matches project? If not, disconnect immediately
  to prevent damage due to writing to wrong addresses
- Connection watchdog to re-open connections if broken
- Find an actual PLC to test and fix bugs without IP attached


Future plans:
================================
- RESTful interface for AJAX :) Semi-asynchronous notification handling
  (HTML query: Retrieve notifications that arrived since id xxx, wait
  for max n seconds if none yet)
- Client/Server functionality for high-speed access from C, Perl,
  Python...
